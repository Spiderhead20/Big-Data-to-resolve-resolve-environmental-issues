# Big Data to resolve environmental issues

This repository stores some Jupiter Notebook files that use data sets regarding environmental data and work around with the statistics in order to display charts and linear regression models just to prove the fact that big data can help us to identify and collect information around these topics.

The research behind this project helps to understand the reason of study behind this issues. Nowadays the enviroment statistics are very alarming, it is in our best interest to do some research around these kind of data,

#### How to use.

Execute any .ipynb notebook to get the results of each analysis, some plots will be displayed to show the results of some linear regression models.
Before executing be sure to unzip the data sets included, they might be a little heavy. Feel free to use any of the datasets provided, not all of them are fully used in any of the files.

As you can see, global temperature is always rising, one of the causes behind global warming and climate change.

As one of the results of these python notebooks, some multiple linear regression helps us to locate and see where the real problem is stored.
